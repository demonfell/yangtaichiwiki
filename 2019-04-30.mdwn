Tuesday April 30

* Parting Wild Horse's Mane
    * When transitioning from Single Whip, turn the left foot to 35 degrees, not fully to corner
    * Step out with the right foot to 15 degrees off of the cardinal direction
    * This is the "less than corner" stance - moving forward in a straight line, not to the corners

* Fair Lady Works Shuttles
    * Horizontal turns for the arms - not a "scooping motion"
    * Emphasize the "push down" for the transitions
    * "While the lower body is open, the upper body is closed"

* Transition from Fair Lady to Grasp Bird's Tail
    * Get the footwork in place before moving the arms

* Snake Creeps Down
   * Correction: Keep the knee over the toe on the back foot -- don't go all the way to corner if you can't
   * Correction: Keep the back at 45 degrees
   * Left Hand - pulls back, pulls down, pushes forward - circular motion

* Emphasis on Control and Feel 

* Needle at Sea Bottom
   * Correction: Keep the back at 45 degrees
   * Keep the gaze forward, not down
       * The Story of the Monkey King getting his sword from the sea from the dragon = look out for the dragon
   * Arm break, not a strike. 
       * Holding the arm, then you press at the side of the shoulder.
