##Stances
### Bow Stance
* Shoulder Width - outside of heel should be in line with outside of shoulders
* Knee should not extend over start of toes, calf should be at 90 degrees
* Weight distribution should be 60% front, 40% back in finished posture
* Weight should be in bubbling well, directly behind ball of foot
* Knee in line with toe direction for both legs - inner-thighs open, qua rounded
* Back leg should not be locked out
* For length of stance, empty and full must be clear. Should be able to pick up front foot without dragging.
* Should lean slightly forward (in most stances) so that angle of back matches back leg. (Note stances that you do not lean in)
* Front foot straight, back foot to 45 degrees
* Step heel, to ball, to toe, make flat, then move weight.
* Turn toes to straight and step forward to measure shoulder width's distance

###Empty Stance
* Feet on one line
* Back foot 45 degrees to corner
* For toe stance, use whole ball of foot, not toe of shoe
* For heel stance, use the whole back of the foot, slightly raising toes off of the ground
* Knee in line with toe direction - inner-thighs open, qua rounded
* Sit down in back leg
* Stance must be long enough, but observe empty and full clearly
* Weight distribution should be 70% back, 30% front

##Hand Shapes
###Palm

* Should sit up
* Should be able to look through tiger mouth in direction of opponent
* Fingers naturally extended
* Striking surface/energy point is in palm heel
* Palm shape should always be the same in the form
* Do not flair the thumb.

### Fist
* Should not be clenched too tightly or too empty
* Thumb on outside
* Always vertical, sitting up
* Striking surface/energy point in front of fist (should be flat)

### Hook hand

* Striking surface back of hand just above wrist


## Notes on application practice
* Must be relaxed and concentrate
