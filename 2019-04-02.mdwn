Tuesday April 2 - 9/10

* Single Whip
	* Sink weight back on the left leg, raise the ball of the right foot off of the ground slightly
	* Hands come across the body, arms are at shoulder height (height of the shoulder sockets), not too low
	* Lead with the waist and let the foot follow, syncrhonized
	* Try to get the chest square and toe pointing to the opposite corner
	* As you bring the weight back onto the left foot, let the weight naturally roll off of the right foot
	* Right arm: make elbow first, then extend. Look in the direction of the hand out of peripheral vision as you extend forearm.
	* Three things at once: Make the hook, left arm wards off, step out on to left heel
		* Keep the rounded shape of ward-off, with the elbow sunken
	    * When you step out on to left heel, should be looking to the corner
	* No stopping -- the left arm rotates over as you shift on to the ball of the left foot, then a quick strike with the left palm
		* Driven by a waist movement to the right
* Correction: do not lift the left foot too far off of the ground during transiitions; should be almost touching the ground
* Cloud hands
	* When you start the posture, bring the hook hand to the cardinal direction, to your right
	* Bring the left hand across the body to the right, but not past the center line
	* Keep the rounded shape from pole-standing
	* Eyes follow in the direction of the energy, but don't look at the hands -- gaze past
	* Steps are toe-to-ball-to-heel, except for the transition when you step to the corner = heel-to-ball-to-toe
		* Transition to Single Whip
			* Use the abductor muscule to make the leg turn into corner stance
			* Right arm wards off, comes "over the top", makes hook
			* Left arm and leg are the same as regular Single Whip
