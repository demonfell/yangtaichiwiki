* Grasp Bird's Tail
    * Ward-off Left
        * Hands in front of hips, edges of hands should match up with outside of shoulders. Circle slightly in direction of turn
        * When arms go in motion, must be round, armpits open. Circular motion is analogous to turning a steering wheel left.  Right arm bends at elbow, left arm moves under like in Cloud Hands.
        * In final posture, L arm should align with left shoulder - wrist should align
with shoulder
        * L foot does not "draw in to central axis" before stepping out = already at shoulder width
        * R palm should sit up at wrist when at top of circle, keeps the same shape as it moves down, tiger's mouth pointing to middle of forearm, elbow turned out, sitting near hip as if resting on something

    * Ward-off Right
        * Pivot inward on Left heel to corner
        * Left hand turns over for grabbing, moves Left, then moves inward back to center

    * Roll-back
        * Not just an arm movement -- use waist. BUT... small arm movements also to emphasize martial intent.
        * Right hand moves from corner to corner direction, up slightly to down.
        * Left arm should be rounded enough, fingers pointing to the center of the right forearm
        * Energy point is center of right forearm.
        * Front leg should not be locked out
        * In final posture, sink hips, relax waist, lean forward 1/2 degree

    * Press
        * Bottom of left palm pushes middle of right forearm
        * Similar body shape to Ward-off Right
        * Time with legs so that bow stance is reached as arms finish
        * Sink right elbow slightly i.e. fingers should be higher than elbow
        * Keep fingers of right hand extended straight, in line
        * Lean forward from waist before and during press
        * Move from lower to higher, top of R wrist in line with shoulder

    * Push
        * Start at mid-body level, hands close to body, then push "upwards" in line with shoulder level.
        * Lean forward from waist before and during push
        * Hands turned slightly inward.
        * Armpits open, chest and elbows sinking.
