* Body principles
    * Relaxation
        * The whole body can be easily moved if one part is tense
    * Structure
        * Instead of "tucking the tailbone," "drop the hips." 
* Is there a "checklist" to think about to decide if you are tense?
    * From the pole-standing posture, move into different static postures
        * "Does it feel the same way as the home posture?"
        * "Can I breathe?"
            * Don't hold your breath -- this will cause tension
* Fair Lady
    * Third section
        * Don't point to the corner of the room -- go to "your" corner in space
        * Make sure bow stance is not too narrow -- do no cross the feet.
* Single Whip
    * For the 135 degree turn, "relax the knees"
* Cloud Hands
