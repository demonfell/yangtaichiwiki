Tuesday March 5

* Ward-off Left
	* Circle of hands at the beginning - like turning a steering wheel left
	* Circle the left hand, bring it under like Cloud Hands
	* Right hand even with with the back hip in ending posture

* Ward-off Right
	* Transition - Left hand looks like a figure 8, moves under, down, back
	* Right hand is like the motion in Cloud Hands, don’t close down the armpits

* Push
	* Transition with separation of hands could have martial application = to separate from a grab
	* Don’t have "chicken wings" - move elbows down but not past body
	* Keep in mind a possible “push down application” when practicing

* Single Whip 
	* Tuck the tailbone (relax the hips)  and open the shoulders
	* Shoulders to less than 45 degrees
	* Sequence of 3 movements at once 
		* Right hand makes hook
		* Ward off with Left arm
		* Left foot comes down on heel
	* Strike as you shift weight into bow stance (*)

* Roll back 
	* Only needs to go corner to corner
	* Concentrate on the waist movement
