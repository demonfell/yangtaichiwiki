* Kicks
	* Heel kick after 2nd Strike Tiger 
		* Correction: Should be a Right heel kick

	* Key Practice Point: Introduced concept of elevator for kicks 
		* Press the button to go from first floor to 2nd floor
		* After kick, press the button to go back to first floor

     * 1st spin - could sink into an empty stance instead of keeping knee up

	 * 2nd spin
	 	* Clockwise on Right foot 
		* Left leg is a low sweeping kick
	    * Back foot ends up as in bow stance in final posture
        * Stay low, lead with the waist

* Grasp Bird's tail
	* Correction: keep elbows lower than hands
	* Correction: Focus on energy point, maintain at mid-body
	* Ward-off Left  
		* Going Left to go Right clarification
			* Body moves to the Right to change foot direction, then back to the Left to step out

	* Hand is never standing up while moving -> tiger mouth to the side

* Single whip
	* 3 motions at once
		* Make the hook
		* Step out with Left foot onto heel
	    * Ward off with the Left hand
	* Put weight down on Left foot as Left hand continues to move into position
	* Move into bow stance as Left hand strikes = splitting energy
    * When making the 135 degree turn on Right foot, try to get the body square to NW
	* Lead with the waist

* Pole standing 
	* Correction: donâ€™t sink into the knees too much
	* Natural standing
	* Not too much wider than shoulder width
	* Peng jin posture is what Left arm in Single Whip should look like in final posture

* Strike Tiger
	* Top hand must move faster
	* Sideways grabbing hand shape
	* Make a fist at the last minute
	* Bottom hand is like opening a door
	* Finish the footwork slightly before making fists
