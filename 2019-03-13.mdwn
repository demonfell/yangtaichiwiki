* Special Parry, Block and Punch after last kick in Kicking Section:
    * Lower down, keep hands up
    * Step down with right foot, just next to the center line, right knee should be slightly-bent
        * Qua starts to open
    * Get right heel down to corner, L arm starts to chamber (not too tight)
    * R hand turns over, moves to side of body, move with waist
    * Bring the weight down on R foot fully
    * L foot is empty, steps forward along with L blocking palm
    * Palm heel should be even with shoulder socket
    * (All waist movements)
    * Punch driven with the back foot, even with the shoulder socket not too low.
    * Round the shoulders - no hunched up brawler stance, no hook punches
    * (Did Exercise where we brought the fist to mid-body, then practiced straight punches)
    * You are punching through the target
    * The gaze follows where the energy goes
        * No need to look back at the hand - look to the side and you can see your hand 
        * From your peripheral vision
    * L hand “follows” the R fist
    * Need to focus on feeling controlled when stepping on to R foot, and getting power from the ground for the punch, and feeling controlled when stepping


* White snake
	* When you make the turn, have the L foot full
	* Open up to the front - like what Ron showed me for Single Whip
	* Step out into what will be how stance - not too narrow, not too short
	* All driven by the waist, no local movements
	* When R heel comes down - fist hits, then when foot goes flat, flicks 
		* Whereas, Chop with fist - Fist hits when the heel touches, then follows through as foot goes flat


* Press
	* Correction: Don’t have the R hand too close to wrist -> center of forearm

* Retreat to Ride Tiger
	* Watch body angles
	* The turn is entirely waist driven. 
            * No local movement.
            * Slow and smooth. 
	* “Keep the shoulders behind the hips”

* 3 warm-ups from Master Wu
	* Move the waist and kick the back of your opposite calf
	* The relaxed “waviing arms” exercise, except you hit the inside of your shoulder with the center of your palm and your kidney
	* Squats - don’t put your knees over your toes

* Foundations - a strike too far out to the side, like a hook, or too closed down, is not powerful
	* Needs to be full-body and open
