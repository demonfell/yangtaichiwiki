Tuesday March 19 - 8/10

* Kicking section after 2nd Separation Kick
	*  Transition to Brush Knee
		* A sweeping motion with the left arm, chamber with right arm, then sweep down and strike in one motion
	* Punch down
		* Sweep low with left arm
		* Side of the knee is a possible target
			* Quad will not be effective as a target, hitting the knee could hurt the hand

* Correction: In transitions, do not lift up the toe too much. Just enough to change direction.

* Embrace Tiger, Return to Mountain
	* Correction: Don't move the right arm up during transition from Cross Hands
	* Rollback - as the left hand turns over into plucking, the right hand comes up through the center of the body 
		* Connects, energy point is center of the arm. 
		* Turn the waist and perform the technique -- waist turn is not too far

* Sweeping kick after the 2nd spin
	* Stay weighted in the front foot
	* Back foot lands in the position of what would be a bow stance to set up for the next kick.

* Cloud hands
	* Connect in the middle of the body with the forearm
	* Bring up the warding-off hand to the center line
	* you are only turning the waist corner to corner on the 45
	* as you reach the corner turn the hand over -- not too late or the technique will not be effective
	* Exercise: just the hands, then add waist movements, then add leg work
	* The pelvis is always pointing forward
