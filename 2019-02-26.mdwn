* Deflect Downward, Parry, Block, and Punch
	* Punch is a straight line, driven by the elbow, in line with the back Right foot
	* don’t hook the punch
	* Steps forward come through the balance point  (a.k.a. Center line, central axis)
		* Naturally, not forced
	* Chambering of the L hand is tighter in PB&P than in brush knee
		* But still never "closed-down"
	* Left hand is a “parry” - pushes a punch out of the way
		* Should be in line with the center of the R forearm
		* A fist’s distance away from the Right arm

* Ward-off Right
	* Right hand should be more obligue to keep rounded arm shape
	* Ensure Left elbow is sunken enough

* Single whip 
	* Correction Do not step out “across” body, let L foot hang momentarily at L side
	* Body should be square to NW (* Less than corner?)

* Press
	* Think of same shape as Ward-off R
	* Left Tiger Mouth points to energy point of Right arm

* Key Practice Point: Daily personal practice is an important part of eventually being able to use Tai Chi Chuan for self-defense
