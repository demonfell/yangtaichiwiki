* Fist Under Elbow
    * Start out in push, move the weight back, flatten out out the hands
    * Make a turn like in Single Whip, bring the left foot straight to the cardinal direction
    * Sit the right hand, turn over the left hand -- full on the right foot
    * Step out with the left foot onto the heel, as if you're stepping into bow stance. Turn the body fully, don't step across
    * Flat ward-off with the left arm. Left and right arms separate from one another.
    * Go flat on the left foot, make the ward off motion with the left arm
    * Begin the circular motion with the left hand, right fist forms
    * Shift weight to the left leg, step out to 45 degrees with right leg
    * Become full on right left - punching and circular lift-up
    * Not a "power punch" - the left arm technique is what will be effective

* Correction: Raise Hands
    * Do not move the left foot on to the center line; it just changes from straight to corner, then the right foot moves in to empty stance

* Tip: sequence from Raise Hands-> White Crane->Brush Knee->Needle -- watch your speed. It is easy to speed up and get going to fast here.

* Needle at sea bottom
    * Reach down like you are shaking hands with a child. Get low = yin
    * When you left up, on the side of your body to the height of your shoulder = yang
    * Do not bend forward; sink into the right leg, body moves back
    * Go as far as you can without straining yourself
    * when you get close to the top is when the hands meet
    * Final posture - right hand close to the temple
    * Correction: don't lock out the back leg, qua rounded

* Opening - do not bend the knees too much. Whereas, Cross Hands, you are crouching, since you are at the heigh in which you do the entire form

* Apparent Closing up - from punching, rotate both hands at the same time
    * Make a body turn to move the right arm
    * Move left arm under
    * Make a body turn to pull right arm away
    * Make another body turn to move into push
    * "Spiralling" energy - seen in Fair Lady, but more subtle here
