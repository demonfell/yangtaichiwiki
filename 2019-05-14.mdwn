* Deflect Downward, Parry Block and Punch 
	* Step in "tight" with the right foot to corner
		* coiling the body like a rubber band in a toy airplane
		* Make the fist when you bring the R hand down by the hip

* Key practice point: Consistency within the form
	* Do the moves the same, the right way every time

* Press
	* Correction: Keep the left hand a least 1 inch away from the wrist

* Stepping backward
    * Should be the same every time you do it. 
    * Do not cross the center line
    * step back toe-to-ball-to-heel
    * You can keep it close on one line but do not cross over

* Do not lean in Single Whip
    * Fan through the Back and Ward-Off left are the other 2 moves

* "Relax the hips"
	* (Instead of "tuck the waist")

* Kicks
	* Keep the kick foot at the corner of the knee and curve the foot
		* Helps balances when standing on the other leg also

* Lotus kick
	* Correction: Do not try to hit the feet when starting. 
	* Make the sweeping motion with the hands and hit the hips
	* Feet should naturally hit hands; does not happen until later
    
* Bend bow, shoot tiger
	* Do not concentrate too much on bringing the right hand to the side of the temple
	* Concentrate on turning the body to generate power
    * Turn both feet to corner for transition to Parry Block and Punch.
